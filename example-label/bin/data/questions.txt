What physical challenges do the astronauts face?
Ar

Very thin (equivalent to Earth's atmosphere at almost 3x height of Mt. Everest) and toxic (too much CO2 and too little O2)
Atmospheric pressure is too low for humans to survive outside without a pressurised suit. Well above the Armstrong Limit where bodily fluids (except circulatory blood) boil away.
Extreme temperatures: (1°F to −161 °F (lowest recorded temperature on Earth is −135.8 °F, in Antarctica)
Harmful ionizing radiation: No global magnetic field + thin atmosphere + no ozone layer
Solar flares: transitory but extreme radiation (will encounter total of ~3-4 during their entire trip, with each one usually lasting a couple of days).
Long periods in reduced gravity (Mars gravity is 37.5% that of earth because of the planet’s smaller diameter and lower mass): unknown physiological effects. Weightlessness impacts almost every system in the body, including bones, muscles, heart, blood vessels, nerves.
Dust devils (10x size of Earth tornados) and planet-wide dust storms

It is believed that in the past Mars had a thicker atmosphere rich in CO2.
